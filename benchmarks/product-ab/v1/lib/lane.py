"""Shared constants and the borrowed `live-model-tools/v1` primitives.

This lane is a sibling of `benchmarks/live-model-tools/v1`, not a fork of it.
The artifact-safety rules and the pairing statistics are *imported* from that
lane so the two cannot drift; nothing here writes to it.

`live-model-tools/v1/lib/statistics.py` shadows the standard library module
name, so it is loaded inside a scope that pops and restores every colliding
`sys.modules` entry. That is the same loader the repository already uses in
`tests/test_live_model_benchmark_framework.py`, and
`tests/test_ci_offline_benchmark.py` asserts the standard library module
survives it.
