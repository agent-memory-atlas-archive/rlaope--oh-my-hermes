"""The skill index lines Hermes sends on every request, rendered the way Hermes renders them.

A skill costs context in two very different ways, and this module measures the
one that is paid per turn. Hermes puts one line per installed skill into the
system prompt's `<available_skills>` block, every request: the skill's name and
its description cut to `SKILL_PROMPT_DESC_LIMIT` characters. The `SKILL.md`
body is not in that block. It loads when the model calls `skill_view(name)` (or
the person types `/skill-name`), costs about 8k characters per load, and then
stays in the conversation history until compaction. `src/skills/context_cost.py`
measures bodies; this module measures the index.

The rendering follows `agent/prompt_builder.py::_render_skills_index` in
hermes-agent: a `  {category}:` header per category directory, then
`    - {name}: {description}` per skill, names sorted inside a category and
categories sorted. OMH installs into `skills.external_dirs`. Hermes would
render a category `DESCRIPTION.md` found there as `  {category}: {description}`
(`_build_skills_system_prompt_inner` reads them from each external dir), but
OMH ships none, so this producer renders bare headers;
`tests/test_per_turn_budgets.py` fails if the packaged skills ever carry one,
since this count would then be short.

The same visible window is what a model reads to decide whether to load a
skill, and Hermes's index preamble tells it to load anything "even partially
relevant". So two skills whose visible windows open with the same words are
two skills a model cannot tell apart until it has paid for both bodies.
`index_opening_collisions` finds them; the structure lint fails on a group that
is not in `REVIEWED_SHARED_INDEX_OPENINGS`.
