"""Reverse-import test selection over a local codegraph.

`omh codegraph build` records which Python file imports which
(`imports_internal` edges). Walking those edges backwards from a changed file
gives every file the recorded edges reach, and the test modules among them are
the smallest set a static reader can name as "the tests that exercise this
change".

Everything here is pure traversal over the codegraph payload: nothing is
imported, executed, or spawned. The result is a starting point for the
smallest test that proves a claim. It is not a substitute for the full suite,
and its blind spots ship inside the payload rather than being left to the
reader to remember.
