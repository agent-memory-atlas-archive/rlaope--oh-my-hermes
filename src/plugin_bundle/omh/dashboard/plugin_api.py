"""Backend half of the OMH Hermes Desktop plugin.

Hermes' web server (``hermes_cli/web_server_dashboard.py``,
``_mount_plugin_api_routes``) imports this file by path as the module
``hermes_dashboard_plugin_omh`` and mounts ``router`` under
``/api/plugins/omh``. That import is standalone -- no package, no ``omh`` on
the path, and the same process as the agent -- so the bundle's reader is
loaded here by path as well, under a private package name, and everything it
needs resolves through the bundle's own relative imports.

``GET /hud?session=<stored session id>`` answers with the ``omh_hud/v1``
payload the modern-TUI widget renders, read for the gateway process's own
Hermes home. A reader failure is answered with HTTP 200 and an error record the
pane shows in place of the lines; the route never raises, because a 500 here
would surface as a red toast on every poll.

The two pure functions, ``load_reader`` and ``hud_payload``, are kept apart
from the route so OMH's own tests can call them without FastAPI, which is the
host's dependency and not OMH's.
