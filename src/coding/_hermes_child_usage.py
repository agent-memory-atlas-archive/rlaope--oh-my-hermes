"""Private reader for a Hermes child's usage ledger.

Hermes writes its ``-z --usage-file`` report for ``-z/--oneshot`` alone, and
that mode cannot read a prompt from stdin (#1824). The child this package
spawns runs ``hermes chat --query-file - --quiet`` instead, so the report is
never written (#1831). The numbers the report would have carried are still
persisted: every API call of the turn queues its token deltas, priced cost,
``cost_status`` and ``cost_source`` into the child's ``sessions`` row of
``$HERMES_HOME/state.db`` (Hermes ``agent/turn_usage.py`` →
``SessionDB.queue_token_counts``), drained at turn finalize and again when the
quiet CLI exits. The dispatcher hands every child a disposable, exclusive
``HERMES_HOME``, so after the child exits and before that home is removed,
every ``sessions`` row in the file is this child's spend and nothing else's.
The child runs with ``--toolsets file --safe-mode``, so no delegate subagent
opens a row of its own and a context-compression rotation is the only source
of a second row; summing all rows therefore reproduces the agent's own
cumulative counters, which is what the ``-z`` report summarized. That
equivalence depends on the toolset restriction: a delegate child writes its
own ``sessions`` row, and the ``-z`` main-loop keys exclude subagent tokens
while its cost includes them, so a later ``--toolsets`` widening that admits
delegation has to revisit this sum.

This is a read-only coupling to a Hermes-private file shape. The columns read
here have been in the ``sessions`` table since Hermes 2026-04 (the cost trio
2026-03), before the ``>=0.21.1`` floor the plugin bundle declares; the
compatibility note lives in ``CONTEXT.md`` (Host surfaces OMH reads). When the
shape moves, this read goes quiet -- ``usage`` stays empty rather than zero --
and no field is estimated.
