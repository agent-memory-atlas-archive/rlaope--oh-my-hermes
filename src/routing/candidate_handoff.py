"""Hand an undecidable route to model selection instead of degrading it.

The deterministic router resolves confident requests well, and it should keep
doing that. What it does badly is the undecided case. Measured on a 24-message
natural-language sample, 8 turns ended in a picker and 2 in a bare fallback,
and 6 produced a score tie the scorer could not break. A user who wrote "PR
리뷰 좀 해줘" got a picker because two skills scored 9 apiece; a user who wrote
"ビルドが失敗した理由を教えて" got nothing because the trigger tables carry no
Kana. In both cases the router had the information needed to shortlist, and
threw it away to ask the user to do the routing instead.

This module turns that dead end into a handoff. When the route is undecidable,
OMH emits the candidates it did find -- each with the reason it matched, its
next action, and its evidence boundary -- and asks the model to choose. Hermes
already understands every language OMH targets and can read a shortlist of four
descriptions; that is the part it is good at.

OMH makes no LLM call here. It assembles candidates and a question; the
selection happens in Hermes. `docs/DIRECTION.md`'s "not an LLM router" boundary
holds, and the payload stays reproducible: the same message yields the same
candidate set and the same digest, so a routing decision remains auditable.
