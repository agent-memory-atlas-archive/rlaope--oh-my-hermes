"""Which `jev-*` skill a message invokes, when it addresses Jev at all.

A message reaches a Jev skill only by ADDRESSING Jev -- asking it, using it,
having it do something, or naming a Jev skill. Mentioning Jev is not enough:
"review the jev plugin PR", "debug why the jev plugin keeps looping", and "is
jev a good coding model?" are about Jev and keep their ordinary owner. That is
why every `jev-*` skill holds its own trigger tokens back and this module is the
only way in.

Precedence, most specific first (fixed, so an ask never depends on scoring):

1. A Jev skill's name in its invocation form (a sigil, or opening the
   message, or after "use").
2. The message addresses Jev (and is not a negation, a configuration, or a
   choice among options) and carries one skill's own phrase, then a cue for
   one skill's job, checked in `_CUE_ORDER`.
3. The message addresses Jev and the ordinary route would have gone, at
   `high` confidence, to a partner workflow in `JEV_SIBLING_BY_PARTNER`: the
   sibling takes it.
4. The message addresses Jev: `jev-ask`, ahead of the generic `ask` skill.

Returns None for everything else, and the router proceeds as if this module
did not exist.
