"""Which commands in an approval's shell line would destroy something, for the slot to show first.

Hermes flags a command line by the first of its dangerous patterns that
matches and names only that one (`detect_dangerous_command`), so a line that
chains a recursive delete with a forced worktree removal and a remote branch
delete reads as "recursive delete" alone. The approval slot shows each command
of the line on its own row and names the risks Hermes did not.

Two small, explicit steps, no shell parser:

- `split_commands` cuts the line at the top-level `&&`, `||`, `;` and line
  breaks, skipping over single quotes, double quotes and backslash escapes.
  A pipe stays inside its command. A comment (`#` starting a word) runs to the
  end of its line, and a here-document (`<<EOF`) stays with the command that
  opened it through its closing line; neither is read for what it runs.
- A command is risky only when a program it runs (its first word after any
  `NAME=value` assignments, the first word of a pipe stage, or the word after
  `sudo`, `env` or `xargs` and their options) matches a row of `RISKS`. Words
  are read quote-aware, so text inside quotes, or an argument to `echo` or
  `grep`, never matches.

`RISKS` is far narrower than Hermes' own table, so what it does not find is
not safe. `Segment.foldable` is a closed allowlist instead: a command may
fold out of sight only when every program it runs reads and changes nothing
(`FOLDABLE`, `GIT_FOLDABLE`, `GH_READ_ONLY`), it writes no file, and nothing
in it runs more than its words say (a substitution, a background job, a
here-document, an open quote, a function or alias the line defines, an
assignment in front of a program, git's `-c`) or reads as a risk inside
quotes (Hermes' patterns are not quote-aware). Everything else is listed.
