"""Which managed skills directory a Hermes home registers, and whether it is one.

`omh setup` and `omh update` register one OMH-managed skills directory in a
Hermes home's `skills.external_dirs`: the shared generation pointer on an
installer-managed command, otherwise the OMH home's own `skills` directory.
Which of them a given home recorded depends only on when it was registered,
so "registered" reads any of them -- a profile left on the older path was
once scored as opted out and frozen on the generation it was installed at.

Two of them at once is a different state, not a wider registration. Hermes
resolves a bare skill name across every external directory and refuses one
that resolves to two different files ("Ambiguous skill name ... Refusing to
guess"); only copies that resolve to the same file count as one. Every
generation refresh makes the pre-pointer copy and the pointer differ, so a
home naming both loses every OMH skill by name (#1857). Setup and update
migrate such a home to the one path the running command writes; `omh doctor`
and the update post-check report a home that still names two, in the same
words. This module is the one place both sides read the candidate set and
spell the finding, so the writer and the readers cannot drift: both match an
entry by its real path, the way Hermes reads it, so a spelling through `~`,
a trailing slash or a symlink is the same directory to the migration that it
is to the finding.

Pure path and text work: no config write, no subprocess, no network.
