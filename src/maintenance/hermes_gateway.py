"""Does a recorded Hermes gateway start predate the OMH bundle its home now carries?

A gateway keeps serving the plugin bundle and skills it loaded at start, so
after `omh update` a bot that was running through the update still answers
with pre-update code until someone restarts it. Update already says
"restart Hermes"; this module says which gateways that sentence is about,
from file evidence alone.

Hermes writes ``<hermes_home>/gateway.pid`` when a gateway starts (a JSON
record: ``pid``, ``kind``, ``argv``, ``start_time``, ``hermes_home``, created
O_EXCL and unlinked on a clean stop) and appends one epoch-seconds line per
start attempt to ``<hermes_home>/gateway-starts.log`` (its respawn-storm
ledger: a bounded ring of ``repr(float)`` lines, written at CLI entry before
the pid-ownership check). The pid record's ``start_time`` is NOT a wall clock
and is never read as one here: Hermes' ``_get_process_start_time`` is
``/proc/<pid>/stat`` field 22 (clock ticks since boot) on Linux and psutil
``create_time() * 100`` (centiseconds) elsewhere -- a per-host PID-reuse
fingerprint. The starts ledger carries the wall clock, so the comparison
reads that: the LAST RECORDED START for the home against the bundle
manifest's ``installed_at``. The stamp is rewritten by every non-dry-run
update, so the hint names a gateway whose last recorded start precedes this
update, which is the restart the update's own restart line is about; it
does not prove the running process is the one that start recorded.

No signal, no process listing, no subprocess, and nothing here raises: a
successful update must not end in a traceback over a ledger line that is
not a number. A pid record Hermes left behind after a crash produces a hint
to restart a gateway that is not running, which costs one line; a missing
record produces no hint even when a gateway runs under some other
supervision, which is the evidence boundary and is said as such. A record
naming a different ``hermes_home`` is another profile's, exactly as Hermes'
own cross-profile guard reads it, and produces nothing.
